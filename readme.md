**If you are using a _Text Completion_ profile, make sure your profile contains API, preset, model, system prompt, instruct template, and  context template.**

**If you are using a _Chat Completion_ profile; API, settings, model would be enough.**

## FAQ

>Why am I creating an extension instead of QR?

My main purpose is to make this tool efficient with [connection profiles](https://docs.sillytavern.app/usage/core-concepts/connection-profiles/). For example, your main API can be Claude Sonnet, it is expensive as hell. But you can use this extension with some cheap/local API.

>What is the purpose of this?

Long-time RP users would know:
- RP models haven't revolutionized like other fields since last year. Programmers now get Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Reason models became very popular. We still have the same crippy llama/mistral fine-tunes.
- In the author's note, there could be `Create interactive scenarios for the player. Keep scenes moving.` note for a better story. But in my experience, most 12B fine-tunes suggest the same things. Models have biases. Even when I swipe, I get similar responses. This is frustrating.

>So is this just a simple LLM request?

Yes. You can do the same thing with:
1. Copy the context. Which contains a character card, chat history, world info, author note, etc.
2. Paste to ChatGPT and say What can I do next?

This extension is a shortcut.
